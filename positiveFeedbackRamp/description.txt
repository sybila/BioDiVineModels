Simple model to illustrate principles of bistability.
Consists of three states. 
Two stable states(0,2) are reachable from the central state(1).
Middle state is also reachable under small portion of 
parametric space (0-0.51) from state 2. 

Therefore the given property holds not only in state 1, but
also in state 2 for parameter valuation 0.51.
